# ownCloud Quick Start Guide

Installing, Configuring, and Connecting to the ownCloud Server

### Abstract
The ownCloud Quick Start Guide is designed to help you quickly install, configure, and connect to an ownCloud server. This guide is aimed primarily at administrators and users.



## Chapter 1. Should I Use This Guide?
The Quick Start Guide enables you to install, configure, and use your ownCloud server based on a set of assumptions about you.

**You should use this guide if the following assumptions apply to your environment:**

* You are an administrator installing and configuring an ownCloud server on a local virtual environment OR you already have a virtual environment that can host the ownCloud server (a DHCP Server is recommended).

* You are an administrator enabling users to connect to the ownCloud server using the serverâ€™s IP address and port 8080.

* You are an administrator adding user accounts.

* You are a user connecting to the ownCloud server via a desktop or mobile client.

Some of the tasks in this guide use example information. You should use values that are specific to your environment.

If your environment does not fit with the first assumption, you can use the following resource to assist you with the installation of a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (a local virtual application):
